# [Gorderhuifam Conflict Resolution Protocol]
- If a team member is unwell, whoever has completed their delegated task first will help complete the unwell team member's part. The unwell team member will help the other team member with their other assigned tasks. Key requirements of the assignment will be priorised.
- When the group has issues, we will reach consensus and solve the issue by majority vote.
- If a team member is having difficulties completing a task, they will flag the issue with other team members via the group chat and  we will work through the issue together.

# [Team member responsibilities:]
- Everyone must use good code documentation to ensure that others can read through the code easily and troublshoot the issue/help complete the task.
- Time estimates will be set to complete tasks
- Updates on our progress on tasks and any issues will be communicated in the group chat and in team meetings, we might use trello (Rhonda will look into this)
- Ensure that diagrams are clear, large and easier for marker/team members to read
